# Airbnb-House-Price-Analysis-and-Prediction
## Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb rental data in Sydney to support hosts, property managers, and real estate investors. It has two main objectives:

Predictive Modeling – Develop machine learning models to estimate daily rental prices. Models include linear, tree-based, and stacked approaches. Performance is compared using cross-validation metrics to identify the most accurate and reliable method.

Data Insights – Extract actionable insights from the data to answer the business question: What are the best hosts doing? The analysis identifies patterns and strategies linked to higher revenue and better performance.

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The final output provides pricing recommendations and practical advice for Airbnb stakeholders.
